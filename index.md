One interesting fact is that some of the world's oldest known cities were established on the land between the Tigris and the Euphrates River. These ancient sites include Ur, Khorsabad and Kufri, which date back about 5000 BC. Ur was one of the largest cities of Mesopotamia, and was the home of many major kings including King Ashurnasirpal II. Khorsabad was the capital of King Shamash-Shuwa.

Another interesting fact is that in early Egyptian times, the pharaohs would wear masks that would depict them as gods. The pharaohs were also believed to have been born from the womb of the goddess Sekhmet. Other myths related to the pharaohs included the fact that they used to ride on a cart pulled by the winged beast of the sky, and that they had red eyes and pointed ears, as well as long hair that fell around their necks.

A third incredibly interesting fact is that the Bible says that the Egyptian pyramids were built to protect the pharaohs and the gods from evil spirits. These structures are actually the oldest buildings in the world, and the largest man-made structures ever constructed. Some scientists believe these structures were constructed hundreds of thousands of years ago, which means that they could have been built by the builders of the Great Pyramid, which is known as Giza. The structure is believed to have been constructed in about 2850 BC.

A fourth interesting fact is that the ancient people who wrote down their history did so using drawings and diagrams. This technique was known as hieroglyphics, and is a form of pictography that has been used in the world since Roman times. This system of writing down history on stone tablet is also referred to as cuneiform, a form of writing that was used by the Greeks. You may notice that there are many similarities between Greek and Egyptian mythology when it comes to using images for story telling.

An interesting fact that is related to the pyramids is that they are believed to be the largest buildings ever built. The Great Pyramid is believed to have been around fourteen thousand feet in height. If this were true, it would make this building around four thousand feet tall, or longer. Even when it is considered to be the tallest pyramid, it is far from being the largest.

Another interesting fact about the pyramids is that they are the largest masonry structures in the world, standing taller than any other building in existence today. When you consider that the United States is just three hundred and forty-five miles in length, it would stand at nearly twice that length.

Some of the other interesting facts about the pyramids include the fact that they are thought to have been built by the Egyptians around twenty-five thousand years ago. The reason that this is believed to be true is that when the pyramids were constructed, they were built in a row, as opposed to the regular, flat top design. It has been estimated that the pyramid's base was about ten thousand feet high.

Another important building that is found in the area is the Pyramids of Giza, which is a very important site for the religion of the ancient Egyptians. There are many statues located in this structure that depict different aspects of the ancient Egyptians. These ancient people were well known for their knowledge of science, mathematics, architecture, and the use of symbols in writing.

The last interesting fact that is important to know about the pyramids of Giza is that they are also believed to be the largest and oldest known structure in the world. These structures are believed to have stood for over four thousand years, which is believed to be the exact amount of time that they were in existence when the pyramids were built. If this were true, it would make them about fourteen thousand years old.

Pyramids of Giza are a great place to find out about the ancient past. In addition to being interesting facts, they are also very interesting places to visit.
